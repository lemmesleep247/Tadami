## About

Tadami is a community fork of Aniyomi with a stronger focus on UI quality, Aurora-style surfaces, and a better reading experience across anime, manga, and novels.

## What Is Different In This Fork

- Aurora-focused UI direction with dedicated Home, library, title, and settings polish.
- Compose-first app shell, with a few intentional legacy View/Fragment bridge surfaces kept where reader, player, auth, or extension compatibility still needs them.
- Full anime, manga, and novel support in one app.
- Novel-oriented development, including compatibility work for LNReader-style ecosystems.
- User-facing Aurora customization toggles for key Home and title-card interactions.

## Module Map

- `app`: app shell, navigation, screens, activities, and feature wiring
- `domain`: business logic, use cases, and repository contracts
- `data`: repository implementations, database handlers, and SQLDelight schemas
- `core/common`: shared networking, preferences, JS helpers, and utility code
- `source-api`: extension contracts and source-facing APIs
- `source-local`: local source implementation details
- `presentation-core` and `presentation-widget`: shared Compose UI building blocks
- `i18n` and `i18n-aniyomi`: resource bundles and translations
- `private-modules`: optional private bridges loaded from local configuration
