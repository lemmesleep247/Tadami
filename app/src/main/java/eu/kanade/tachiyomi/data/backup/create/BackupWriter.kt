/**
 * Writes a backup so that a half-written or silently truncated file can never replace a good one.
 *
 * The bytes are compressed in the cache directory first and verified there at the wire level: the
 * staged artifact must decompress back to exactly the serialized payload (streaming digest), and
 * the payload must still declare the expected origin and content counts (top level protobuf field
 * scan, no objects materialized). A full decode is deliberately not used: a second object graph
 * does not fit in RAM next to the payload and the creator's own graph, and it exhausted the 256 MB
 * heap on small-heap devices (OutOfMemoryError). The destination is then compared against the
 * staged bytes with a streaming digest, because a SAF provider is free to accept a write and store
 * something else (or nothing at all). Everything streams: no second compressed copy, no full
 * payload copy and no decoded object graph ever sit in RAM next to the payload.
