/**
 * Platform-independent state machine that decides when the Cloudflare challenge resolve
 * loop should stop waiting for a `cf_clearance` cookie.
 *
 * Cloudflare challenges resolve asynchronously: the JS `challenge-platform` payload runs
 * after the first `onPageFinished`, and modern managed challenges may set the clearance
 * cookie in the same document without a navigation/redirect. The cookie can therefore
 * appear well after the last `onPageFinished`, so the resolver must *poll* for it rather
 * than inspect it once. This class isolates that timing logic (no WebView / Handler /
 * Android dependency) so it can be unit-tested on the JVM.
